###### *Most of the following content is either in progress or to be added*

### Some content within the mod:
- New ores: aluminum, magnesium, osmium, tungsten, uranium, and plenty more
- Alloys: carbonite, Futurite, Sermium, steel, and some mysterious alloys
- Lots of natural generation: marble, limestone, evergreen trees, willow trees, and plants

### Biomes:
**The Coniferous Forest** is a place for tree lovers to go. Filled with tall, beautiful evergreen trees, the forest is well suited for creatures of magnificent beauty.

**The Dense Coniferous Forest** is much like the coniferous forest, but packed to the brim with trees. Stay too long, you can easily lose yourself in the forest and never find the way out.

**The Geyser Plains** might look empty, but there are plenty of springs and fresh pools of water and an unknown substance. Quite an unusual and mystifying place.

**The Mystic Hills**, often bordered by geyser plains, is home to the most unusual terrain. A dead wasteland, with willow trees scattered about and little wildlife. Something is hidden deep within this biome, something dangerous.

**The Salt Basin** is a large hilly biome with very limited water, but a lot of salt!

### Mobs:
