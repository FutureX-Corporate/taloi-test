That's A Lot Of Items credits and info:

All art, code, and textures were made by me, NewJumper.

This project started off as a huge list of items, blocks, tools, armor, weapons,
and a lot more in a Google Docs, but I soon realized it was going to be quite a
task for me to single-handedly code and add these to a mod. I later shortened the
list to a reasonable amount of items to start with. Next I started to go to work,
adding most of the ores, wood, and blocks that I curated in the list.

This mod is a culmination of a variety of mods I love and play such as Thermal
Dynamics, Mekanism, Galacticraft, and plenty more. I hope that someday my mod will
grow and include most, if not all, the items and blocks that my original list had.

Thank you to all who playtested TALOI and gave feedback.
